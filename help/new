I dare you to @ the bot

**Commands**
`!mememaker` and `!deepfry` no longer search messages sent by the bot
`!joke` will now read the joke aloud when the bot is in a voice channel

**Music Player**
`!connect`
`!disconnect`
`!continue` is now `!resume` because it makes more sense/easier to type

**Voice Commands**
Turned up the sound on the `!warrior` command
`!connect`
`!disconnect`

**Dev Tools**
`!eval`
`!print`
